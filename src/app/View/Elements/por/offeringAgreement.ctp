<ul>
     <li>The run.codes service is provided without any guarantee;</li>
     <li>run.codes may be interrupted without prior notice, including interruptions that may affect the system at times close to the exercise delivery deadlines;</li>
     <li>The automatic correction process is susceptible to failure. run.codes will not be held responsible for the grades given to the submissions made, this value being only a correction parameter, and which must always be validated by those responsible for the discipline.</li>
