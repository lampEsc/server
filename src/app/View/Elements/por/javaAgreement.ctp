<strong>Attention:</strong>To be correctly corrected, your code must be delivered in a single .java file:
<ul>
     <li>cannot define a specific package;</li>
     <li>cannot define any public class;</li>
     <li>must, obligatorily, define a class <strong>"Main"</strong> with the "main" method that will be called to start execution.</li>
</ul>
This is due to the characteristics of the Java language, if you have any questions, please contact support@run.codes.
