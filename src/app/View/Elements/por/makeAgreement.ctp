<strong>Attention: </strong>To be correctly corrected, your code must be delivered in a single Zip/Makefile:
<ul>
     <li>there must be a Makefile file at the root of the zip file;</li>
     <li>must contain <strong>only</strong> the <strong>compile</strong> command in the "all" directive (that is, the "make all" command will be executed to compile your code);</li> li>
     <li>must contain <strong>only</strong> the <strong>execution</strong> command in the "run" directive (that is, the "make run" command will be executed to execute your code);</li> li>
</ul>
If your Makefile does not follow the instructions above, your code will not be fixed. If you have any questions, please contact support@run.codes.
