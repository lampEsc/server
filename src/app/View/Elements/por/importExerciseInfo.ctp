When importing an exercise, a "copy" of the original exercise will be made for your class. This way, an exercise will be added with the same title, description, test cases and attached files as the original exercise. After copying, there will be no connection between the original exercise and the new exercise. This way, it will be possible to modify any information, add or delete test cases and attached files. Modifications to the original or imported exercise will not have any effect on the other respective exercise.
